The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var children= 0;
var partner= "Francisco";
var geo= "Miami";
var job= "dog mom";

console.log("You will be a " + job + " in " + geo + " and married to " + partner + " with " + children + " kids.");
